= RESTful APIs tests

This is a repo just to play with RESTful APIs and understand how they are integrated with databases and ORMs.

In this case I'm using `Flask`, `SQLAlchemy` and `Marshmallow`

This project uses https://medium.com/@kelvin.onkundi/python-rest-apis-with-flask-sqlalchemy-and-marshmallow-501b2d803a25[Kelvin Onkundi's article] as a starting point.
